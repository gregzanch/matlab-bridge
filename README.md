# Matlab Bridge üåÅ

Runs Matlab code in typescript/javascript

[![NPM Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/esta.svg?style=flat)](https://npmjs.org/package/matlab-bridge)

## Overview

This package acts as a middle man between node.js and Matlab. You can interact with Matlab through a `Session`, which is simply a wrapper around Matlab's REPL

## Prerequisites

Before using `matlab-bridge`, you should have [jsonlab](https://github.com/fangq/jsonlab) installed as a Matlab toolbox. You can download the latest release from [jsonlab's release page](https://github.com/fangq/jsonlab/releases).

## Getting started

Add `matlab-bridge` to your node.js project.

```shell
yarn add matlab-bridge
```

Creating a `Session`

```js
const session = new MatlabSession();
await session.initialize();
```

Evaluating a block of code

```js
const output = await session.evaluateScript(`
  a = linspace(1, 5, 5)';
  b = a .* 2;
  result.a = a;
  result.b = b;
  jsonencode(result)
`);
```

Get the whole workspace
```js
const workspace = await session.getWorkspace();
```
